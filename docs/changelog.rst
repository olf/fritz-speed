Version 0.1.2
-------------

* add the possibility to change the graphing style (line or area and its color)
  directly from the configuration file.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

*  When creating a new rra for traffic data, the maximum line speed is queried
   from the router and used as a valid upper limit. This avoids spikes in the
   traffic graph originating from traffic counter resets on reconnects.
